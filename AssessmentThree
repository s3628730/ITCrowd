Assignment 3

Team's personal information:
Hawa Nour: s3662356
I am currently completing my second year at RMIT University studying Psychology. 
I am originally from Eritrea. my family and I migrated to Australia when I was just baby and its where we have remained ever since. 
One hobby of mine that I do quite often is reading. It is something that I have always done when I feel the need to escape reality for a little while. 
My interest in IT arose from me constantly reading books. Reading genres like sci-fi caused my interest to flourish. 
My previous IT experience is very limited however it is something that I have always wanted to pursue and this IT class has given me an avenue to finally get started on IT.

Yen Hai Tran: s3729125
I have moved to Australia from Vietnam a year ago and as you can guess, I speak both Vietnamese and English. 
I love Yoga and I learnt Yoga a long time ago but still keep practising it as it helps boost both my health, my energy and my feelings. 
I have a background in telecommunications and have worked in the industry for several years. 
I always enjoy keeping up with latest technologies in the Information Technology field. I like to tinker with my computer, to learn about how components in an IT system work together. 
I also love to build my own applications that can fulfill my own needs, as well as be beneficial to my friends and other people. 
The more I play with IT, the more my love for it grows, and I decided it is time to go back to the University to follow my passion. 
I'm currently working as a casual technical support for Sequel Home Based Care, an aged care company. The company has performance issues in their client management application, which I have fixed, and have learnt some new knowledge and experience in SQL server management.

Swee Kim Au Yong: s3535765
I was originally from Malaysia moved to Western Australia, Perth at 2010 then moved to Melbourne at 2012 or 2013 to finish my Year 11 and 12
My hobbies are basically just playing games, and playing a sport called Badminton while sometimes I would also do online courses out of boredom on the web and explore history related subjects. 
My interest in Information Technology started long when I first had my computer at the age of 12, ever since then whenever I came back from school I would sit down and explore the virtual world of different possibilities. 
My sister was also another reason why I definitely pinned on this course because of how she had describe the interesting subjects that could be done, the broad aspects of IT has different fields of interest led me to doing a diploma to try all spectrum of IT for the first time and I enjoyed it. 
My IT experience is introductory level only as I have only done and graduated from Diploma of IT, however I'm working towards to learning more in depth of what I had done in the diploma to pursue my interest and follow my sister's footsteps.

Nitya Handa: s3697811
I'm Nitya Handa, originally Indian but born and raised in Phuket, Thailand. I went to school in British international school, Phuket and that's where I was able to learn English and Thai. I learnt Hindi and home with my parents and now I am fluent in all three languages. I graduated from the same school with an IB diploma and IGCSE certificate. I enjoyed growing up on a tropical island it was very relaxing.
My hobbies include socializing watching TV shows but most of all I enjoy dancing.
I have always been interested in IT from a young age and always wanted to be a part of the community that creates the technology. 
My background in IT isn't that strong, I took IT in IGCSE and learnt HTML, CSS, and how to use software within the computers along with what the parts of it are.

Patrick Wright: s3628730
Originally I am from Hobart, Tasmania and I moved to Melbourne in 2014. I come from a commercial fishing family that specialized in Abalone and Crayfish, which outside of school took up most of my time and allowed me to have some wonderful experiences I will never forget. 
My hobbies include cardiovascular exercise, following the North Melbourne football team in the AFL, and computer gaming. 
My interest in Information Technology lies mainly in the field of software engineering, I am excited about the future possibilities of artificial intelligence and I am eager to take a path through university that will lead me to hopefully one day working in this area.
My previous experience in IT is very minimal however, when working in administration I did spend a little time assisting new staff with computer station setups, as well as some phone line patching in the company's server room.

Career Plans - Patrick
Compare and contrast career plans for everybody in the group. This will include our ideal jobs but everybody needs to come up with a career plan, for post study to get to the role they listed as their ideal job. 
Example:
Pick a few key attributes of each role then table them up and do some comparing and contrasting. Focus on soft skills and technical skills.

Group Processes-Hawa
I think we worked well together for our assignment 2. 
Everyone took on a section that they were capable of completing well. 
I think one thing that ensured that our group dynamic would work perfectly was that each member embraced their responsibility and ensured that they would be meeting the groups requirements. 
One thing that made communication for our group go smoothly was the use of our Facebook Messenger group. 
Whenever each of us had a problem we would send a message and other members would help them with whatever issue they were facing. 
Some changes we would hope to introduce for this assignment is using GitHub more. 
Now that everyone has learned how to navigate its features we can all contribute to uploading our work onto it. 
Another change to introduce is better time management of uploading work. 
This would ensure that we have enough time to review work before the due date.

To compare and contrast the variety of roles we have inside our group, the information needs to be split into two sections; soft skills, and technical skills. 
In the soft skills section, there is a big commonality, and some differences. The main commonality we see is that all the IT based roles in our group share the same soft skills as each other, leaving psychology as an outlier. Although Psychology is an outlier, it does share the most important soft skill which is communication. Communication plays a vital role in almost any job so it is not surprising to see it high on both lists. But outside of that psychologyâ€™s values of ethics and patience whilst still very important skills do not rank as high in the IT world. This is likely due to the nature of the work undertaken, whilst both roles involve communication, psychology focuses on one-on-one human interaction of a personal nature, whereas IT involves collaboration from a team to solve technical problems in an organised manner.

Project Description 

Plans and Progress

Project overview-hawa
Our project idea aims to create an application that will be available on both android and apple devices. The project idea is a Public Transport Assistant Application that strives to ease the stress of using public transport. Using the GPS features on the device the application aims to set prompts that appear as notifications informing the user of their location and the distance remaining of their travel. Our application will also be able to function efficiently without the need for WIFI connection. 
A main feature of this application is that it is to be set in real-time. This along with the reminders ensures that users will have the time to relax and not worry about missing their destination. This project aims to be one that can function in the background allowing travellers to use their device leisurely all the while receiving reminders throughout their journey. 
One main motivation for this application is that it aims to create an ideal experience for travellers and eases the burden of travelling to new destinations. Another motivation that propelled this project idea was that the existing travel applications were not up to standard and had problematic features that our transport helper aims to overcome. A current trend that exists nowadays is being a foodie and trying new restaurants and cafes. Our application fits into this trend because it makes travelling to these restaurants that may be set in an unfamiliar settings easier and enjoyable. A reason that this project idea would be interesting to a potential future employer is that although this project idea is not a new one it demonstrates that we are capable of pinpointing a problematic situation and creating a more efficient solution to the already existing ones.
Some applications that are quite similar to our transport assistant are google maps, MapQuest, maps.me and several others. These applications use GPS to assist commuters in reaching their requested destinations. These applications aim to do the same thing our transport assistant does but differ in some features. Our application will differ from others by having increased tracking accuracy to ensure that it is working in real-time. This feature is lacking in applications like google maps where the delayed time-frame and tracking issues often causes me and many others to miss our desired destinations. Another feature that makes our application differ from the rest is that we aim to create an application that works efficiently without the need for WIFI connection. Often times travel application features are limited because WIFI network issues that can cause lagging within the application and create a hinderance for the user. Our travel helper strives to overcome these issues by not being dependent on WIFI. This allows travellers to use our travel assistant even when they are travelling to an area that has limited WIFI connections. Although our application is able to function offline, when there is accessible WIFI our application is able to inform users of travel delays that may be caused due to accidents or road developments occurring within their destination path.

Project details
Phase 1: Requirement gathering/ Analysis
Analysing usersâ€™ current issues and needs
Conduct user research methods to gather data from the users using public transport by conducting quick surveys on a wide range of users via the social network and direct observation some real users while they are using other navigation apps for traveling by public transport. Our aim is to understand their current issues as well as their needs to ensure that our product application will satisfy true user requirements.

Identify main functionalities of the app
Base on the user requirements and analysing functionalities of current competitive products (google map, PTV), we conduct group meetings all members to brainstorm a list of major functionalities of the product to enable users to accomplish tasks to reach their goals. Moreover, setting the scope of the project is also determined at this stage to make sure we are always on the right track to create expected deliverables within a tight timeframe.

Outcomes:
-	Current issues of users using public transport
â€¢	Donâ€™t know when to get off
â€¢	Easy to get lost

-	Current needs:
â€¢	Be reminded of when to get off on time without constantly keeping track of their journey or destination
â€¢	Have multiple options for setting up the reminders based on time or distance to the destination

-	App functionalities:
â€¢	Set up reminder for an address
â€¢	Set up reminders for a journey
â€¢	Bookmark addresses and journeys
â€¢	Flexible options for setting up reminders based on time and location
Phase 2: System requirement 
This was conducted via group meeting of project manager and technical members to analyse the insight of tools and technologies needed to implement the mobile apps in two versions of iOS and Android. All of hardware, software and licence are listed explicitly to assess and prepare initial resources needed for the project.
Outcomes: As described in the tools and technologies section.
Phase 3: Production planning
As we have requirements and functionalities well defined, the purpose of this stage is breaking down the main functionalities into smaller tasks until they cannot be further subdivided. This makes management of division of work, assignment of human resources and tracking of the project progress easier.
 

Phase 4: Initial low fidelity mock ups and wireframe
In this phase, we focus on defining target user groups, creating personas and context scenarios. Then, proceed creating the key path scenarios together with wireframes to define low fidelity mock-ups for the app. The main point of mock-ups/wireframes is to clarify the project functionalities and shape the design direction. User testing is preferred to start from this stage to make sure the app is on track in the design and business sense. 
Outcomes:

   
Phase 5:  UI/UX design (Interaction Prototype)
At this stage, UX/UI designer will build the interaction prototype of user interface of the app using Sketch and InvisionApp. Prototypes are used to examine how users interact with the app, to reveal usability problems and find out whether the implemented functionalities have been meeting the usersâ€™ requirements or not. At this point, we start a cycle of usability testing and fixing by conducting user testing with the real users on the prototype and observation of how they react, how many issues they meet, how quickly they can perform their tasks, then create a new improved prototype and start the process again.

Phase 7:  Software testing
In this stage, the app is tested before it is delivered to target users. During the software testing phase, the testers aim to find errors or bugs that need to be resolved within the app as well as verifying whether the app behaves as expected or not to make amendments if necessary. Once issues are found, testers inform the developers about the details of the issues to be fixed and the fixed bugs will be updated in the latest version. This cycle is repeated until all requirements have been tested and all the bugs have been fixed and the software is ready to be shipped.
Phase 8: Beta testing
In this stage, all bugs and errors are supposed to be fixed from the software testing phase. Beta testing is carried out by beta users of the app in the real environment which help us to get the insight of how users are using the apps. This stage is the crucial step to find the usability issues as well as unforeseen errors of the apps to create a high-quality products or services which meet user requirements.
We aim to find about as many beta testers as possible via both online and offline sources such as social media (Facebook, Twitter), forums and communities (Quora, Reddit) and personal contacts. Any bugs and usability issues found will be fixed or adjusted and updated, to prepare for the first version of the app.
Phase 9: Launch
As all bugs fixed and all usability issues resolved, the first versions of the app are released on App store for iOS, and Google Play for Android.

Group Reflections

Hawa's reflection
I think one thing that really went really well was that we all had adapted to each others working styles because of our previous group work on assignment 2 and the presentation. 
Because of this we were quick to jump into allocating sections and getting a start on our work. 
Something that we could have improved on is our time management.
As previously stated in group processes, time management is a feature that we could improve to ensure that we are working at our best. 
What surprised me when completing this assignment was how much easier it was to complete the workload.
Working on the previous assignments showed me what was required of me and this knowledge assisted me in the completion of this assignment.

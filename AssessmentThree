Team's personal information:
Hawa Nour: s3662356
I am currently completing my second year at RMIT University studying Psychology. 
I am originally from Eritrea. my family and I migrated to Australia when I was just baby and its where we have remained ever since. 
One hobby of mine that I do quite often is reading. It is something that I have always done when I feel the need to escape reality for a little while. 
My interest in IT arose from me constantly reading books. Reading genres like sci-fi caused my interest to flourish. 
My previous IT experience is very limited however it is something that I have always wanted to pursue and this IT class has given me an avenue to finally get started on IT.

Yen Hai Tran: s3729125
I have moved to Australia from Vietnam a year ago and as you can guess, I speak both Vietnamese and English. 
I love Yoga and I learnt Yoga a long time ago but still keep practising it as it helps boost both my health, my energy and my feelings. 
I have a background in telecommunications and have worked in the industry for several years. 
I always enjoy keeping up with latest technologies in the Information Technology field. I like to tinker with my computer, to learn about how components in an IT system work together. 
I also love to build my own applications that can fulfill my own needs, as well as be beneficial to my friends and other people. 
The more I play with IT, the more my love for it grows, and I decided it is time to go back to the University to follow my passion. 
I'm currently working as a casual technical support for Sequel Home Based Care, an aged care company. The company has performance issues in their client management application, which I have fixed, and have learnt some new knowledge and experience in SQL server management.

My hobbies are basically just playing games, and playing a sport called Badminton while sometimes I would also do online courses out of boredom on the web and explore history related subjects. 
My interest in Information Technology started long when I first had my computer at the age of 12, ever since then whenever I came back from school I would sit down and explore the virtual world of different possibilities. 
My sister was also another reason why I definitely pinned on this course because of how she had describe the interesting subjects that could be done, the broad aspects of IT has different fields of interest led me to doing a diploma to try all spectrum of IT for the first time and I enjoyed it. 
My IT experience is introductory level only as I have only done and graduated from Diploma of IT, however I'm working towards to learning more in depth of what I had done in the diploma to pursue my interest and follow my sister's footsteps.

Nitya Handa: s3697811
I'm Nitya Handa, originally Indian but born and raised in Phuket, Thailand. I went to school in British international school, Phuket and that's where I was able to learn English and Thai. I learnt Hindi and home with my parents and now I am fluent in all three languages. I graduated from the same school with an IB diploma and IGCSE certificate. I enjoyed growing up on a tropical island it was very relaxing.
My hobbies include socializing watching TV shows but most of all I enjoy dancing.
I have always been interested in IT from a young age and always wanted to be a part of the community that creates the technology. 
My background in IT isn't that strong, I took IT in IGCSE and learnt HTML, CSS, and how to use software within the computers along with what the parts of it are.

Patrick Wright: s3628730
Originally I am from Hobart, Tasmania and I moved to Melbourne in 2014. I come from a commercial fishing family that specialized in Abalone and Crayfish, which outside of school took up most of my time and allowed me to have some wonderful experiences I will never forget. 
My hobbies include cardiovascular exercise, following the North Melbourne football team in the AFL, and computer gaming. 
My interest in Information Technology lies mainly in the field of software engineering, I am excited about the future possibilities of artificial intelligence and I am eager to take a path through university that will lead me to hopefully one day working in this area.
My previous experience in IT is very minimal however, when working in administration I did spend a little time assisting new staff with computer station setups, as well as some phone line patching in the company's server room.

Career Plans - Patrick
Compare and contrast career plans for everybody in the group. This will include our ideal jobs but everybody needs to come up with a career plan, for post study to get to the role they listed as their ideal job. 
Example:
Pick a few key attributes of each role then table them up and do some comparing and contrasting. Focus on soft skills and technical skills.

To compare and contrast the variety of roles we have inside our group, the information needs to be split into two sections; soft skills, and technical skills. 
In the soft skills section, there is a big commonality, and some differences. The main commonality we see is that all the IT based roles in our group share the same soft skills as each other, leaving psychology as an outlier. Although Psychology is an outlier, it does share the most important soft skill which is communication. Communication plays a vital role in almost any job so it is not surprising to see it high on both lists. But outside of that psychologyâ€™s values of ethics and patience whilst still very important skills do not rank as high in the IT world. This is likely due to the nature of the work undertaken, whilst both roles involve communication, psychology focuses on one-on-one human interaction of a personal nature, whereas IT involves collaboration from a team to solve technical problems in an organised manner.

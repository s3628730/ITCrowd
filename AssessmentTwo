my personal information

I am currently completing my second year at Rmit University studying Psychology. 
I am originally from Eritrea. my family and i migrated to Australia when i was just baby and its where we have remained ever since. 
One hobby of mine that i do quite often is reading. It is something that i have always done when i feel the need to escape reality for a little while. 
My interest in IT arose from me constantly reading books. Reading genres like sci-fi caused my interest to flourish.

Originally I am from Hobart, Tasmania and I moved to Melbourne in 2014. I come from a commercial fishing family that specialised in Abalone and Crayfish, which outside of school took up most of my time and allowed me to have some wonderful experiences I will never forget. 
My hobbies include cardiovascular exercise, following the North Melbourne football team in the AFL, and computer gaming. 
My interest in Information Technology lies mainly in the field of software engineering, I am excited about the future possibilities of artificial intelligence and I am eager to take a path through university that will lead me to hopefully one day working in this area.
My previous experience in IT is very minimal however, when working in administration I did spend a little time assisting new staff with computer station setups, as well as some phone line patching in the company’s server room.

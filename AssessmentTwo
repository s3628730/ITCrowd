Originally I am from Hobart, Tasmania and I moved to Melbourne in 2014. I come from a commercial fishing family that specialised in Abalone and Crayfish, which outside of school took up most of my time and allowed me to have some wonderful experiences I will never forget. 
My hobbies include cardiovascular exercise, following the North Melbourne football team in the AFL, and computer gaming. 
My interest in Information Technology lies mainly in the field of software engineering, I am excited about the future possibilities of artificial intelligence and I am eager to take a path through university that will lead me to hopefully one day working in this area.
My previous experience in IT is very minimal however, when working in administration I did spend a little time assisting new staff with computer station setups, as well as some phone line patching in the company’s server room.

I have moved to Australia from Vietnam a year ago and as you can guess, I speak both Vietnamese and English. I love Yoga and I learnt Yoga a long time ago but still keep practising it as it helps boost both my health, my energy and my feelings. I have a background in telecommunications and have worked in the industry for several years. I always enjoy keeping up with latest technologies in the Information Technology field. I like to tinker with my computer, to learn about how components in an IT system work together. I also love to build my own applications that can fulfill my own needs, as well as be beneficial to my friends and other people. The more I play with IT, the more my love for it grows, and I decided it is time to go back to the University to follow my passion. I'm currently working as a casual technical support for Sequel Home Based Care, an aged care company. The company has performance issues in their client management application, which I have fixed, and have learnt some new knowledge and experience in SQL server management.
My idea job is the Full Stack Application Developer, which requires contributions in all levels of a web application, from back end and database to front-end. I like to have a complete picture of a product I build, to understand all technical aspects of the application, and contribute to all phases of the project, so a full-stack developer position is appealing to me.

Hi, I’m Nitya Handa! I’m Indian born and raised in a beautiful island Phuket, Thailand. started British International School, Phuket in 2001 and graduated from there in 2017. Being a part of that community allowed 
me to learn how to speak English and socialise with people from all around the world. My hobbies include watching movies and socialising but I’m most passionate about dancing. From an early age I’ve always been deeply 
interested in technology. All the devices that were created at the time were always “the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!” As I grew the opportunities grew and it always kept me wondering if I could, one day, make or be a part of making 
the newest and the ‘coolest’ future technologies. My background in IT is minimal, I did take it as a subject in year 10-11, IGCSE. We learnt HTML and CSS, how a computer is built, how its operated and how the software’s within them work. Not much other 
than that and my own research to keep updated with the growing market.

Day in the life of a Software Engineer 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQbhpAmz2f8

A day in the life of a software engineer is a busy, but exciting one. Health tends to be of high priority, so eating healthy and exercising is a must. Software Engineering companies tend to be flexible on work times (starts and finishes) but the expectation is that you still complete all your work. The first task of the day tends to be checking emails, this is to ensure there is no problems that require immediate attention, or a shift in the days plan. Somewhere around the middle of the morning the team will get together and have what is known as a ‘stand up’. This is a meeting where everybody in your team, including managers stand in a circle, and communicate the following information to each other:
• Goals for the day
• What you plan to work on for the next 24 hours
• What you have been working on for the past 24 hours
• If you have any blockers (anything stopping you from continuing on a project)
• Seeking any advice or support from team members
The main advantage of the stand up is to make everybody aware of where you are at, and if they can help. Sometimes they might be the reason for you having a blocker, and might be able to directly fix it post meeting. In some situations after the stand up you may break off into smaller groups to discuss further some of the information that was presented in the stand up.
Communication is of vital importance and seems to take up a lot of a software engineers day. Because there is so much collaboration on projects, there is a lot of meetings to be had each day, where you can help others, or recieve help as you need it.
Meetings can range from project meeting, to whole team meetings, to one-on-one meetings to discuss personal development. In some businesses some meetings will be specifically for improving upon technical knowledge and rebounding ideas of each other to learn productively. 
From a technical standpoint, throughout the day you may schedule time to tasks such as; solving algorithmic problems, answering business related questions, code reviews, design reviews, peer reviews, meetings,  troubleshooting or bug fixing. 
As there is so much going on prioritising is very important, and scheduling time for this alone will go a long way to making your day a lot smoother.

A security engineer can be an in-house resource, or work as a consultant for other customers. For the latter case, for a new customer, the typical tasks usually start with an initial onboarding process, where the engineer conducts an initial assessment of the customer’s current IT system by reviewing the security infrastructure and policies, and how critical resources are performing and how they are monitored. He or she then produces a report of the assessment and any recommendation or action items to follow to fix or improve the security of the system. 
Then depending on the contract, would be routine maintenance, where the security engineer keeps monitoring the system with industry or custom tools and programs, response to security incidents in a timely manner, to ensure the system is running smoothly and securely.
Things will get busier when there is a major incident or breach where data is stolen or destroyed. The security engineer needs to take action immediately, usually as a team, to resolve the problem as soon as possible. It usually involves fixing the flaws causing the incidence, updating the system with latest patches, recovering data, and perform risk analysis that other teams can base on to follow up with their actions.
When things are not as busy, they would often spend time on research and development by keeping up with the latest security news and technologies, learning new techniques or spending time in labs, trying to break things to test their security. Some find this the most exciting part of their jobs. This usually results in new or improved security solutions for the system that help make it more stable and secure against future threats.  
During the initial onboarding stage, they work with customer teams, lead analysts, and the delivery managers to develop expectations for monitoring and service level agreements (SLAs). As the first point of contact for the customer in the routine maintenance process, they often work closely with customers and other team members to identify and troubleshoot any detected vulnerabilities and security threats.
Most of the time, they spend on working at the company office. Sometimes, they are out to attend security conferences or industry events or conduct seminars for transferring knowledge at customer sites.
Because of the nature of network attacks are unpredictable, the most challenge of the security engineer is the capacity to quickly adapt and come up with a solution in a timely manner as there was no way to take control all the data and threats.
Moreover, researching and developing new techniques and policies to prevent future incidents is also a huge challenge for them, in particular and in general for the cyber security industry, the security engineers have to constantly keep up with the latest exploits and attacks as well as apply latest technology to come up with efficient security solutions.


IT Technologies

Machine Learning
The idea of Machine Learning began from the theory that computers can learn from recognising patterns without having to be programmed to do it, in a bit more depth; the computer uses algorithms to autonomously learn from data and information its given, it does not have to be explicitly programmed, it can adapt and improve its algorithms on its own. Machine Learning is known as a sub-set of Artificial Intelligence. 
The origins of Machine Learning can be dated back as far as ‘The Turing Test’, developed by Alan Turing in 1950. The test is designed to determine if a computer has real intelligence, to pass the test the computer must fool a human into believing it is also human. 
Since 1950 many milestones have been achieved in this subset, to list a few:
• In 1962 Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer learning program. It was used by the IBM computer to play the game of checkers, and the more it played, the better it became by studying which moves formed winning strategies and then incorporating them into its program.
• In 1967 the ‘nearest neighbour’ algorithm or the ‘travelling salesman problem’ as it is known today, was developed. This program allowed the computer to begin using basic pattern recognition, to map the route for a traveling salesman. The idea was to start in a random city but ensuring every city is visited using the shortest possible route.
• In the 1990’s an important change in direction occured. Machine Learning moved from a knowledge-driven approach to a data-driven approach(#ref). Programs were developed for computers to analyze large amounts of data and to then learn from the results.
• In 2006 the term ‘Deep Learning’ was coined by renowned computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton. 
After the bursts of progress between 1950 and the late 1980’s momentum in Machine Learning did slow for some time. But since 2010 momentum has been regained and some big steps have been taken. 

Currently the most impressive feat performed by Machine Learning was when Google’s artificial intelligence algorithm (known as AlphaGo) beat a professional Go player. The reason this is so significant is because GO is openly considered the world’s most complex board game.

Machine Learning algorithms are used widely in today’s society. Examples include:
• The finance industry where algorithms analyse data to prevent fraud or identify important insights that help investors to know when to trade.
• The transportation industry where algorithms are used to identify patterns in traffic data to help make routes more efficient or predicting potential problems. 
• In the healthcare industry algorithms can be used to help medical experts analyse large amounts of data to identify patterns or issues that may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of patients.
• And ofcourse, it is used in the area self-driving vehicles. Machine learning algorithms are used to find solutions to challenges as they arise in the development of the vehicles. The data is gathered using a range of sensors in the car, which are controlled by the ECU.

The future of Machine Learning is very bright and there are so many new and innovative solutions coming that it’s just not practical to list them all, so I will try and list what I believe are the most important ones. It is suggested that the healthcare industry will be adapted heavily with machine learning algorithms. Adaptations include using algorithms to help prevent certain diseases and cancers, which is vitally important to the future of our society, another area will be in the development of more intelligent prostheses.
Another industry that will benefit greatly from these algorithms is the agricultural industry. In the future expect to see algorithms used to assess crop and soil health, to manage agricultural robots to perform farming tasks, and even predictive analysis to optimize business growth, and crop growth.

I think the main reason all this is becoming possible is because of the rapid growing interest in the field of Machine Learning, which is being driven harder than ever because of massive computer hardware improvements in recent times, which in turn has allowed us to collect more and better data than we have ever had before, which in turn leads to better algorithms and better application of Machine Learning.

What is the likely impact?
As stated above the potential impact of Machine Learning on the world is likely to be huge, but mostly in a positive direction. It is likely that there will be many changes, but to generalise a bit, humans will be doing less manual tasks, which will be done by algorithms, as they are faster and more accurate than us. In turn humans will spend more time interpreting results and implementing new procedures, or products based on the analytical results from the algorithms they use. Society will likely see a shift in job aspirations with the younger generations towards data analysis and sciences, programming will become a staple in schools (if it isn’t already), and overall we will hopefully become more efficient as a race. A lot of jobs will become redundant but lots more possibilities will open up and areas we haven’t even created yet. I think the most affected humans will be generation X, because they will be closer to retirement, and if their manual jobs become redundant they won’t have the time, or likely the understanding in most cases to make the shift to data and computer sciences.

How will this affect you?
As I am a information technology student with strong interests in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, this shift will only give me more opportunities career wise. For me I think the most valuable contribution I could make through machine learning is giving back through the healthcare sector. There is so much momentum and opportunity to save lives through computers and algorithms, and with an ageing population in Australia especially we will see an increase in a need for more efficient treatment plans and diagnosis processes. Another area I could see myself dealing with machine learning would be in the sports industry, maybe working with a professional team in AFL, using algorithms to develop winning plays and player strategies, to improve overall team performance week to week. This is a feasible idea because all players wear tracking devices in game and a company called Champion Data tracks everything about the players, from movement patterns to speeds to rest times to even hot and cold zones, all of which could be very useful in a machine learning environment.

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies - Anna

Blockchain is a technology that powers cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides a distributed system which is basically a digital ledger that can record transactions between two parties in an efficient, verifiable and permanent.
The system is secure by design, in that identical blocks of information are stored across its network in a decentralised manner and there is no single point of failure. The robustness of the technology, together with its transparency – everyone can access the record transactions publicly and verify them – and other strengths, have made Blockchain one of the most current influential and promising technologies with a lot of potential to disrupt or replace many traditional industries and businesses.

The blockchain is made up by a network of ‘nodes’, computers connected to the blockchain network to perform tasks of validating and relaying transactions, with the incentive to be possibly rewarded by earning the cryptocurrency of the network. Unlike the traditional model, this is a peer-to-peer network requiring no central servers or any intermediate nodes to authenticate or approve transactions.
Thanks to its underlying cryptography and hashing techniques, it is very difficult to tamper the transactions. The decentralised structure makes it incorruptible and almost unhackable. Not only transaction information is publicly accessible, but also the implementations are mostly open source for public scrutiny. All these things have made blockchain a platform for truth, where everyone can trust it. This is an important point that made cryptocurrencies possible and helped blockchain become popular in the recent years.

Blockchain, as a technology, is evolving quickly. First introduced with bitcoin, as innovative as it was, it came with some problems. Transactions can take a long time to finish which is undesirable in many cases. It also requires a lot of computational power and energy from the nodes. New technologies have emerged, particularly with Ethereum or some other new cryptocurrencies, have made the transactions faster and more robust.
The new technology also made Ethereum not just a cryptocurrency but also a platform, where other forms of transactions can be made, and helps enable smart contracts which can be applied in many financial and business transactions.
Blockchain is expected to continue to evolve quickly and be mature enough to be popular in many traditional services in the next three years.

At the moment blockchain is mostly used in cryptocurrencies, where it acts as the underlying technology that allows two parties to send and receive money in digital format using public and private key pairs.
However, blockchain, with its innovative features, is also being applied in the financial and banking sector where traditional methods are not very efficient, such as to speed up cross border payments, reduce fraud, enable smart contracts and real-time point-to-point transfer of funds between financial institutions and thus remove frictions and accelerate settlement.

As more people are realising the benefits and potential of blockchain and are investing heavily into it, blockchain is expected to also disrupt or revolutionise IT sectors such as cloud computing as well as traditional industries such as shipping industry, with big names like Maersk and Hyundai are testing blockchain in their logistic network and transport network, according to Bloomberg.
The nature of blockchain, as a great place to store, retrieve and verify information, will also allow other information related fields such as supply chain management, copyright registration, insurance industry, logistic industry, online voting, managing medical records. Some companies such as Samsung and IBM are also looking into applying blockchain into Internet of Things, to create a decentralised network of IoT devices. The combination of two of the biggest technologies are expected to be result in a lot of innovation that may help revolutionise even more fields and hopefully will help improve the quality of life of many people.

What is the likely impact? Not finished
As mentioned above, businesses and operations based on blockchain technology get many benefit from cost saving to reducing processing delays caused by traditional methods, prevent single point of error as well as guarantee the integrity of data stored on the system. This technology will have a significantly impact on the tradition financial industry and ecommerce cross-border trading. Many banks are interested in this technology because of the potential to simplify and improve the efficiency of the current complex and expensive system.  System based-on the blockchain will automate processing payment transactions instead of using human involvement processing.  This will make a huge redundant on the front-office staff of jobs in banks and commercial trading offices.

How will this affect you? Not finished
This technology really changed my mindset in thinking of construction of database system. This let me recognise an alternative method for storing data secure and think of the new generation of database system. In my opinion, beside of advantages of the blockchain technology, it’s also have downsides in term of requiring a number of nodes distributed in the system large enough to increase the security of the system. The larger system is, the more powerful nodes required in the system for solving problem related to validate transactions and adding new node into the block to maintain the information processing speed. Users including me is the one who receive more benefits from this technology, they have many options in choosing upcoming services with reasonable cost. As a IT student aimed to be a software developer in future, I’m able to create a small private blockchain, in which I can clearly understand the mechanism of blockchain in order to implement for my idea in creating a system to manage digital certificates of students in education system, that can be verified via blockchain network.

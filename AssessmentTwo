I am currently completing my second year at Rmit University studying Psychology. 
I am originally from Eritrea. my family and i migrated to Australia when i was just baby and its where we have remained ever since. 
One hobby of mine that i do quite often is reading. It is something that i have always done when i feel the need to escape reality for a little while. 
My interest in IT arose from me constantly reading books. Reading genres like sci-fi caused my interest to flourish.

Originally I am from Hobart, Tasmania and I moved to Melbourne in 2014. I come from a commercial fishing family that specialised in Abalone and Crayfish, which outside of school took up most of my time and allowed me to have some wonderful experiences I will never forget. 
My hobbies include cardiovascular exercise, following the North Melbourne football team in the AFL, and computer gaming. 
My interest in Information Technology lies mainly in the field of software engineering, I am excited about the future possibilities of artificial intelligence and I am eager to take a path through university that will lead me to hopefully one day working in this area.
My previous experience in IT is very minimal however, when working in administration I did spend a little time assisting new staff with computer station setups, as well as some phone line patching in the company’s server room.

I have moved to Australia from Vietnam a year ago and as you can guess, I speak both Vietnamese and English. I love Yoga and I learnt Yoga a long time ago but still keep practising it as it helps boost both my health, my energy and my feelings. I would recommend you give it a try too.
I have a background in telecommunications and have worked in the industry for several years, I am passionate about IT, that why I have decided to enroll in the Bachelor of Information Technology program in RMIT and would like to pursue my career in that field.
I always enjoy keeping up with latest technologies in the Information Technology field. I like to tinker with my computer, to learn about how components in an IT system work together. I also love to build my own applications that can fulfill my own needs, as well as be beneficial to my friends and other people. The more I play with IT, the more my love for it grows, and I decided it is time to go back to the University to follow my passion.

My previous job as a system administrator in a telecom company in VietNam. Currently, I'm working as a casual technical support for Sequel Home Based Care, an aged care company. The company has performance issues in their client management application, which I have fixed, and have learnt some new knowledge and experience in SQL server management.

My idea job is the Full Stack Application Developer, which requires contributions in all levels of a web application, from back end and database to front-end. I like to have a complete picture of a product I build, to understand all technical aspects of the application, and contribute to all phases of the project, so a full-stack developer position is appealing to me. In addition, the role requires a lot of collaborations with other engineers, designers and product owners. I love interacting with people and exchange ideas, so this is another part that makes the job interesting to me. Moreover, the job requires a high standard for implementation. I always think that it is important to produce good quality code that is maintainable, not some spaghetti code that is likely to become technical debt in the future. I believe that working in a place with a high standard of code quality will help me advance my skills, learn from the team, and further develop my career.

Test outcome:
Myers-Briggs test result: Introvert Sensing Feeling Perceiving - ISFP: The Adventure
Learning style test result: Visual learner
Agreeableness test result: Average in Agreeableness

I was originally from Malaysia moved to Western Australia, Perth at 2010 then moved to Melbourne at 2012 or 2013 to finish my Year 11 and 12
My hobbies are basically just playing games, and playing a sport called Badminton while sometimes I would also do online courses out of boredom on the web and explore history related subjects.
My interest in Information Technology started long when I first had my computer at the age of 12, ever since then whenever I came back from school I would sit down and explore the virtual world of different possibilities.
My sister was also another reason why I definitely pinned on this course because of how she had describe the interesting subjects that could be done, the broad aspects of IT has different fields of interest led me to doing a diploma to try all spectrum of IT for the first time and I enjoyed it.
My IT experience is introductory level only as I have only done and graduated from Diploma of IT, however I'm working towards to learning more in depth of what I had done in the diploma to pursue my interest and follow my sister's footsteps.

Hi, I’m Nitya Handa! I’m Indian born and raised in a beautiful island Phuket, Thailand. started British International School, Phuket in 2001 and graduated from there in 2017. Being a part of that community allowed 
me to learn how to speak English and socialise with people from all around the world. My hobbies include watching movies and socialising but I’m most passionate about dancing. From an early age I’ve always been deeply 
interested in technology. All the devices that were created at the time were always “the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!” As I grew the opportunities grew and it always kept me wondering if I could, one day, make or be a part of making 
the newest and the ‘coolest’ future technologies. My background in IT is minimal, I did take it as a subject in year 10-11, IGCSE. We learnt HTML and CSS, how a computer is built, how its operated and how the software’s within them work. Not much other 
than that and my own research to keep updated with the growing market.

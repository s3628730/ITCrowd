Name: Hawa Nour, s3662356

I am currently completing my second year at Rmit University studying Psychology.
I am originally from Eritrea. my family and i migrated to Australia when i was just baby and its where we have remained ever since.
One hobby of mine that i do quite often is reading. It is something that i have always done when i feel the need to escape reality for a little while.
My interest in IT arose from me constantly reading books. Reading genres like sci-fi caused my interest to flourish.
My previous IT expereince is very limited however it is something that i have always wanted to persue and this IT class has given me an avenue to finally get started on IT.
